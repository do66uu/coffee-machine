What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break?
A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. 
It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and get a cup of energy. 

The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, water, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. 
You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino and latte. 
Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.
